# LangChain + Next.js

This template scaffolds a LangChain.js + Next.js starter app. It showcases how to use and combine LangChain modules for several
use cases. Specifically:

- [Simple chat](/app/api/chat/route.ts)

The agents use [LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/), LangChain's framework for building agentic workflows. They use preconfigured helper functions to minimize boilerplate, but you can replace them with custom graphs as desired.

It's free-tier friendly too! Check out the [bundle size stats below](#-bundle-size).

You can check out a hosted version of this repo here: https://langchain-nextjs-template.vercel.app/

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key.

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager (e.g. `yarn`).

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

## Structured Output

The second example shows how to have a model return output according to a specific schema using OpenAI Functions.

## Agents

To try out the agent example, you'll need to give the agent access to the internet by populating the `SERPAPI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
Head over to [the SERP API website](https://serpapi.com/) and get an API key if you don't already have one.

## Retrieval

The retrieval examples both use Supabase as a vector store. However, you can swap in
[another supported vector store](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores) if preferred by changing
the code under `app/api/retrieval/ingest/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts`, and `app/api/chat/retrieval_agents/route.ts`.

For Supabase, follow [these instructions](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase) to set up your
database, then get your database URL and private key and paste them into `.env.local`.

You can then switch to the `Retrieval` and `Retrieval Agent` examples. The default document text is pulled from the LangChain.js retrieval
use case docs, but you can change them to whatever text you'd like.

For a given text, you'll only need to press `Upload` once. Pressing it again will re-ingest the docs, resulting in duplicates.
You can clear your Supabase vector store by navigating to the console and running `DELETE FROM documents;`.

After splitting, embedding, and uploading some text, you're ready to ask questions!

## Bundle size

The bundle size for LangChain itself is quite small. After compression and chunk splitting, for the RAG use case LangChain uses 37.32 KB of code space (as of [@langchain/core 0.1.15](https://npmjs.com/package/@langchain/core)), which is less than 4% of the total Vercel free tier edge function alottment of 1 MB:

This package has [@next/bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer) set up by default - you can explore the bundle size interactively by running:

```bash
$ ANALYZE=true yarn build
```

## Learn More

The example chains in the `app/api/chat/route.ts` and `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts` files use
[LangChain Expression Language](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language) to
compose different LangChain.js modules together. You can integrate other retrievers, agents, preconfigured chains, and more too, though keep in mind
`HttpResponseOutputParser` is meant to be used directly with model output.
